CHAPTER - 1 ------>

Introduction :

The Project "Online Laboratory Management system" is an Automated full stack web project
for E-lab Management. It eases the tasks of the user/patient as well as lab administrator and 
other staff of any Diagnostic centre.

The main objective of this project is to provide the solution for an medical laboratory 
to provide the facilities available online as a part of E-Lab (portal for equipped for conducting 
tests suggested by medical experts). This software also helps the administrator and instructor(s) to maintain
proper documentation of the computing systems.

This software is a web-based application and can be hosted on the internet. It also provides a clean and
user-friendly interface to the users/patients.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose :

The purpose of this project is to provide the solution of a local medical test laboratories 
to help in monitoring it's online services and provides it's existence globally through internet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Need/motivation :

We visited a local medical test laboratory/diagnostic centre and asked them about if they have their
own Website/software online which keeps tracks of their individual users/patients and provide them
an option to book a test slot online or atleast book an appointment if their phone services are busy 
are busy in some cases.
It is also difficult for the administrator to integrate entire information of all the patients/users data o
who did their medical tests there. Our software solves these problems


=====================================================================


Technical Requirements :

1)	Functional Requirements ->
-	It Should provide the display available services in the diagnostic centre without any of the clashes between the day, time and all available services must be visible to all.
-	It should add all the services/tests selected by the registered user in his account portal.
-	It should generate a report about the registered complaint to the admin and response report to the user who has submitted his queries (via email).
-	User must be able to select all the tests/services he wants to take from the E-lab software.
-	Secure registration and profile management facilities for different users.
-	It should generate alerts via SMS and Email.

2)	Non-Functional Requirements ->

Safety Requirements
If there is extensive damage to a wide portion of the database due to catastrophic failure, such as a disk crash, the recovery method restores a past copy of the database that was backed up to archival storage 

Security Requirements
Security systems need database storage just like many other applications. However, the special requirements of the security market mean that vendors must choose their database partner carefully.

•	Hardware Requirements :
1.	A recent model of computer with at least 4gb of ram is sufficient for web full stack project.  (8gb is recommended)
2.	A dual-core processor ( quad-core is recommended for better performance )
3.	Solid-State Drive (SSD) is recommended for storage ( minimum 256 gb for faster computations and efficient working).

•	Software Requirements :
1.	HTML, CSS, JavaScript  as front-end languages (for dynamic = thyme Leafe template or JSP) and React. Angular as frameworks.
2.	Reference of bootstrap or tailwind for front-end development.
3.	Java(Spring boot) for backend development.
4.	MySQL as a database.
