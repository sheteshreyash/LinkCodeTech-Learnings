Introduction
The main objective of the java program is to create two files to read two files by using Threads. One is to read files using implementing the Runnable interface and the other is to test the class with the sample files. The java files are ThreadReader.java and MainThread.java 

The ThreadReader.java class implements the Runnable interface and override the run method. The constructor takes a file name as an input file name. The run method will open the file for reading and display the content of the file. 

In the main method of the MainThread.java, create two objects of the ThreadReader class and pass the name of the files as arguments. Then call the run method to start reading the sample files, sample1.txt and sample2.txt

 

Step 2
ThreadReader.java class source code

//ThreadReader.java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;
//Java class, ThreadReader that implements the Runnable interface
public class ThreadReader implements Runnable
{
 private String filename;
 //Constructor that takes filename as input string
 public ThreadReader(String filename)
 {
  this.filename=filename;
 }
 /*Override the run method that opens file 
  * and read the file data line by line and with some
  * sample randome sleep time */
 public void run()
 {
  Scanner filereader=null;
  try 
  {
   //Open file stream Scanner object to read filename
   filereader=new Scanner(new File(filename));
   while(filereader.hasNextLine())
   {
    //print the name of the file 
    System.out.println("File Name: "+filename);
    //Call Sleep method to sleep for a random time
    //for every line to display 
    Thread.sleep((long) (Math.random()*1000));
    //display the text of file 
    System.out.println(filereader.nextLine());
   }
   //close the file filereader object
   filereader.close();
  } 
  catch (FileNotFoundException e) 
  {
   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
  } 
  catch (InterruptedException e) 
  {
   e.printStackTrace();
  }
 }
}

Step 3
MainThread.java source code

//MainThread.java
public class MainThread 
{
 public static void main(String[] args) 
 {
  //Set two file names as string variables
  String file1="sample1.txt";
  String file2="sample2.txt";
  //Create an object of the ThreadReader class with file1
  ThreadReader t1 = new ThreadReader(file1);
  //Create an object of the ThreadReader class with file2
  ThreadReader t2= new ThreadReader(file2);
  //call run method to start the thread t1
  t1.run();
  //call run method to start the thread t2
  t2.run();
 } //end of the method
}//end of the class,MainThread

Step 4
Sample text files

sample1.txt

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing 
and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries.

sample2.txt

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum 
is not simply random text. It has roots in 
a piece of classical Latin literature from 
45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia
